Applying the genomics pipeline to more short reads from the same study, you will identify variants in month-children groups and then you can do multiple things.
 - family tree: look at the VCF files, identify common mutations for families, create a tree
 - worl map tree: create consensus sequences for a few reads and then compare those with the population sequences from all over the world to create world map tree
 - Gene Functions: check out genes with mutations, their functions
