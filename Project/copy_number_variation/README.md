# Copy number variations in MSI vs MSS colorectal cancer

## Project Overview

Copy number alterations (CNAs) are somatic changes that cause the gain or loss of DNA sections (>1â€‰kb) from a normal genome. There are three major molecular pathways involved in colorectal cancer (CRC), including the chromosomal instability (found in 85% cases), microsatellite instability (MSI) and CpG island methylator phenotype pathways. In this project, we are going to explore the different patterns of copy number variations across CRC tumors (MSI vs MSS).
